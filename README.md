# Deploy Application to AWS 

Scripts to help you deploying an application to AWS services, such as AWS ECS and AWS Lambda.

These are built to reduce the time that you waste having to input all the commands in the terminal used to deploy an application to AWS.

## How to start

For the scripts to work, they have to be in the root folder of your application.

Depending on your operating system and the platform that you want to deploy to, copy the files in the folders to the root folder of your application. 

e.g. if you are on Windows and want to deploy an application to AWS Lambda, go to *Windows Powershell/AWS Lambda*

###Using the scripts

After you did that, open a terminal in the root folder of your application and use:

#### For Windows

```
.\<name-of-the-script>.ps1
```

#### For Unix and MAC

Open a terminal in the root folder of your application and use:

```
chmod +x <name-of-the-script>.sh
sh <name-of-the-script>.sh
```
